Min conecpt is the kind of combinations:
CASe1: at ta
i.e if both char are different then we can min of at ta
CASe2: if two char are same
aa bb
we can take even number from it
For the last form all the combinations we need only 1
eg aa aa     bb bb  if we have dd and ee we can put only one not both
